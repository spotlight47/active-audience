Heat map of all geographic areas in terms of population densitiy and proximity to live events.
Heat map showing vehicle traffic surrounding event venues.  (assumes a small percentage are attending live arts venues).
Volume map:  showing total market and breakdown of market by proportion of market.

Revisiting on 3/30/2019 --> all of this pre-work is still valid.  Heat map function would be ideal.  

I need to come back to this project again and again; all of my previous experiences will align with this website.
